# Performance Benchmark for Doctrine ORM

Allows testing relative performance of versions to each other, given
a Doctrine2 Git checkout root directory.

Code base is originally from the http://code.google.com/p/php-orm-benchmark/
suite, but heavily modified to allow for easier extension and cross version testing.

## Usage

    php run-all-tags.php <doctrine2-git-dir>

Outputs a CSV format

    php run.php <doctrine2-git-dir>

Outputs a JSON with the Tests executed, their duration and the SQL Queries used.

## Missing performance tests

* Events
* Merge/Detach
* Metadata Serialization/Unserialization
* DQL Parsing
* Heavy ChangeSet computation (only a light one for now)
* Big Entity (with many fields)
